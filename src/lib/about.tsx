        <p>
          As a UX (User Experience) designer, my responsibility is to advocate
          for the users of an information system by designing meaningful and
          relevant experiences that both meet business goals and iteratively
          improve the usability, functionality, and satisfaction of the product.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I'm also responsible for driving UX maturity and user centred
          development through continuous collaboration and mentoring within my
          organisation.

    title: 'What are my values?',
    content: (
      <>
        <p>My core values are empathy and transparency.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Empathy combined with active listening to understand not only what
            people say that they want, but also what they need.
          </li>

          <li>
            Transparency via a clearly defined process, and continuous
            communication, meaning that I constantly work to have my team and
            stakeholders aligned with my design decisions - minimizing unwelcome
            surprises or scope creep at design reviews, facilitating the ability
            for my code-partners to carry out smooth and fast implementation of
            new features.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <p>
          I'm also data informed rather than data driven, meaning that I use
          data as one of several inputs in the decision making process, balanced
          with other factors such as experience, intuition and context.
        </p>

      <>
        <p>
          Like most designers who were around during the wild west of the early
          internet, I first became interested in web design when I pirated
          Photoshop on my familys' big boxy home computer. From there, I started
          freelancing in web development and Ui design.
        </p>

        <p>
          After traveling around the world and working from my computer during
          my early twenties, I decided to deepen my understanding of IT by
          studying software engineering and product management at University of
          Gothenburg.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've since worked with UX under many different titles - service
          designer, product designer, and UX designer, for big corporations as
          well as start-ups.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Today I work as a UX generalist, from early stage user research to
          high fidelity design deliveries.
