        <p>
          As a UX (User Experience) designer, I'm responsible for advocating for
          the users of an information system by designing meaningful and
          relevant experiences that both meet business goals and iteratively
          improve the usability, functionality, and satisfaction of the product.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I usually work as a "UX generalist", which means that I float in
          between research and visual design, grabbing the tools needed in any
          given moment, based on my previous experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          My core values in my everyday work-life are empathy and transparency.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Empathy combined with active listening to understand not only what
            people say that they want, but also what they need.
          </li>

          <li>
            Transparency via a clearly defined process, and continuous
            communication, meaning that I constantly work to have my team and
            stakeholders aligned with my design decisions - minimizing unwelcome
            surprises or scope creep at design reviews, facilitating the ability
            for my code-partners to carry out smooth and fast implementation of
            new features.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <p>
          I'm also data informed rather than data driven, meaning that I use
          data as one of several inputs in the decision making process, balanced
          it with other factors such as experience, intuition and context.
