        <p>
          As a UX (User Experience) designer, I'm responsible for advocating for
          the users of an information system by designing meaningful and
          relevant experiences that both meet business goals and iteratively
          improve the usability, functionality, and satisfaction of the product.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I usually work as a "UX generalist", which means that I float in
          between research and visual design, grabbing the tools needed in the
          given moment, based on the context and my previous experience.

        <p>
          My core values in my everyday work-life are empathy and transparency.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Empathy combined with active listening to understand not only what
            people say that they want, but also what they need.
          </li>

          <li>
            Transparency via a clearly defined process, and continuous
            communication, meaning that I constantly work to have my team and
            stakeholders aligned with my design decisions - minimizing unwelcome
            surprises or scope creep at design reviews, facilitating the ability
            for my code-partners to carry out smooth and fast implementation of
            new features.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <p>
          I'm also data informed rather than data driven, meaning that I use
          data as one of several inputs in the decision making process, balanced
          with other factors such as experience, intuition and context.

        <p>
          Like most designers who were around during the wild west of the early
          internet, I first became interested in web design when I pirated
          Photoshop on my familys' big boxy home computer. From there, I started
          out in freelancing, splitting my time between both frontend
          development and Ui design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then I have traveled the world picking up odd digital design and
          development work for NGOs that share my values and passions, worked in
          big organisations back home in Sweden as both a service designer and a
          UX designer, and also once as a product designer for an early stage
          start-up where I was wearing all the hats imaginable.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I've also studied software engineering and product management at
          Gothenburg University, and while I don't code professionally anymore,
          it has definitely helped me to understand the technical feasibility of
          my designs so that I can offer a more holistic approach to problem
          solving.
