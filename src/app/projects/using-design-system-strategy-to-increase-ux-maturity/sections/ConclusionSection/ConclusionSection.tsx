        Using Figma to engage developers and train them on how to use the
        external components had an immediate positive impact on our user
        experience. With the biggest improvements seen in navigation, data input
        accuracy, and readability. By providing clear design patterns and
        hands-on guidance, we helped developers understand how to create higher
        quality frontend UI that matches our design goals. This approach made
        our teams more user-focused and improved the consistency of our internal
        tools.

        The long-term goal is to fully align the look and feel of the outsourced
        frontend library with our central design system. This will create a more
        cohesive and streamlined user experience across all platforms. While the
        collaborative tools and training were a great first step, they also set
        the stage for future improvements as we continue to refine and integrate
        our design system.
