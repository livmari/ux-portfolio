        The project was voted second favourite at the end of the innovation
        sprint, which was personally encouraging, but also highlighted a shared
        experience among developers in large organisations like Volvo Cars. This
        recognition underscores a crucial point: while commercial applications
        offer clear insights into system status and health, internal business
        tools often lack this level of transparency, especially when the
        end-user and purchaser are not the same person.

        By prioritising visibility and transparency in internal business
        software, we can foster a more solution-oriented culture that bridges
        the gap between DevOps and business. The design presented in this
        project not only enhances collaboration and engagement across teams but
        also lays the groundwork for a healthier, more productive system
        environment where success is celebrated collectively.
